I am currently a psychometrist II at the Cleveland Clinic, as well as a student in Case Western Reserve University’s Masters of Biostatistics program. This website will be used as a source all of things Trenton, and will be updated to include information regarding my employment, research interests/activities, as well as sharing other websites/blogs I find quite resourceful.\nTo begin, my research interests spread quite widely, from neurology, to sports medicine, LBGTQ+ community health, taste pharmacology and so forth, with an analytical interest in machine learning within these different domains. I am open-minded in learning/researching other areas outside of my expertise to further grow and assist wherever I am able.\nMy current area of research delves into neuropsychological disorders/diseases and understanding how to utilize cognitive assessments in order to better predict/pinpoint these disorders/diseases. Specifically, I have assisted in studies looking at pediatric epilepsy, as well as dementia studies all looking to assess neuropsychological functioning within these populations.\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to discuss potential projects."

    "text": "Hindbrain CB1 Receptor Agonism via CP55940 Administration Decreases Motor Behavior, But Does Not Increase Intake of Palatable Fluids\nSystemic and central administration of cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonistic drugs increases intake, especially of palatable foods and fluids. Taste undoubtedly plays a role in food selection, and CB1 receptor agonism may, even in part, mediate its appetite effects via the taste system. A possible neuroanatomical site of action of these taste-guided intake effects is the hindbrain. Indeed, 4th ventricular (4icv) administration of the CB1 receptor agonist CP55940 (CP) increases intake of a palatable fluid by male and female rats in a need-free state (Miller et al 2004). We sought to replicate this and assess if the findings would extend to pure sucrose solutions. In the present study, ad libitum-fed male (n=4) and female (n=7) Sprague-Dawley rats were anesthetized and underwent stereotaxic surgery for implantation of a 4icv cannula; analgesia and prophylactic antibiotic were provided during surgery and for 3 consecutive days following. Ten days after surgery, the rats were acclimated to sweetened condensed milk (SCM diluted in reverse osmosis water; 1:3) by providing free access to it in their home cages for 3-h sessions on each of 4 days. The rats were then, on separate days and interspersed with a 48-h washout, infused 4icv with vehicle (VEH; 0.9% sterile saline, 1μl) and CP (1ng for males, 10ng for females) immediately prior to 3-h SCM access. During both training and testing, standard chow was removed 30min prior to SCM access, and SCM intake was measured at 1h and 3h. Repeated measures 2-way ANOVA revealed no effect of CP on SCM intake; cannula functionality was confirmed by observing at least a 150% increase in blood glucose levels 45 minutes after administration of 5-thio-d-glucose (75µg, 1μl). Because our results were incongruent with previous findings, we sought to confirm that the CP was behaviorally active. Thus we assessed the motor behavior of the rats described above in an open field following VEH in one test and a higher dose of CP (30μg in 1μl, 4icv as per Miller et al 2004). in a second; infusions occurred 15min into a 30-min acclimation period that preceded the 30-min test. Videos of the tests were collected, and the duration of ambulation and number of rearing events that occurred during the 1st minute of each 5-min bin during the tests was scored under blinded conditions. Repeated measures 2-way ANOVA revealed than CP decreased ambulation and the number of times the rats reared. This confirms that the drug was behaviorally active, even though we were unable to replicate the previously reported intake effect. Overall, these findings suggest that the hindbrain is not a consistent site of action by which CB1 receptor agonists mediate their effects on appetite for palatable food."

In an age where so much helpful information is continually put behind paywalls, a donation-based availability feels like fresh air.\nOne topic Jeff Leek talks about that taught me quite a bit was starting on page 29 talking about open data sharing and then again regarding posting code/software packages. More specifically, Learning what steps to take to improve documentation of both data and packages. Taking steps to make data more easily accessible has had lasting effects on my own productivity, as well as can be quite beneficial for others’. Being able to have data, packages, portfolios, all at the ready and organized simply can shave away so much time and stress when trying to collaborate with other researchers for whatever reason. This also will have a lasting effect on reproduceability as well. Files and packages that are easy to set up leave more time for other data analysts to focus on how to better observe what’s being researched. Thus more progress can be made.\nIn my own experiences, re-structuring my folders and how I name all files has been an immense help when it comes to my own analyses. Along with that, cleaning up a function on a previous analysis makes it quicker to input the necessary code and spend more time trying to understand the observations/creating a sufficient model to answer my research questions."
